# Restaurant-Website-Template
This is a template for a static restaurant website. 
It is meant to be fully responsive and accessible.
Each component can be restyled and edited with ease.

Foods can be added and removed from the menu list by inserting new objects into the 'menudata.js' file. New items added to the objects will be automatically added to the menu page.

Carousel images can be added and removed from the 'carouseldata.js' file by editing the paths in the object. New images will be automatically added to the carousel.
